## Email Testing with Mailosaur
For email testing, have used Mailosaur to handle test emails.Ensure the following:
- **Mailosaur Account**: Sign up for a Mailosaur account and obtain your API key.
- **Update Cypress Config**: Update your cypress.config.js file with your Mailosaur API key and server id.

## Troubleshooting
- **issue**: Tests fail due to an email already existing
- **Solution**: update 'email' in 'fixture/testdata.json' and 'testEmail' in 'cypress.config.js' files.
- **Note**: For emails, the domain is [@gadx3q6t.mailosaur.net], and anything before it should be unique. The value of 'email' and 'testEmail' should be same.

## MetaMask Connection Test
- Connects to MetaMask, adds a custom etherem chain, and links the account.
- **Note**: Manually unlock your Metamask account during test.Password to add manually: 'Password@123'.


## Achievements and Challenges
- Successfully automated the creation of a new account.
- Asserted email verification by logging in, overcoming the absence of UI for the "Verify Now" button.
- Initiated the connection with the Metamask wallet, up to the point where the Metamask extension opens.
- Currently, the password change functionality is failing due to known issue (KYC failure).This prevents successful password changes. Therefore, have Automated Negative Scenarios
